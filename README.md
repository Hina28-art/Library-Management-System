# Library-Management-System
This Java code creates a Library Management System with Book and Library classes. Users can add, remove, search, borrow, and return books via a command-line interface. The Book class defines properties like title and author, while the Library class manages the collection. A menu-driven interface allows for efficient user interactions.
