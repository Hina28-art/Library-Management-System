This Java code implements a simple Library Management System. It defines two main classes: Book, which represents individual books with attributes like title, author, and availability, and Library, which manages a collection of books. Users can add, remove, search for, borrow, and return books through a command-line interface. The main method provides a menu-driven approach for user interaction, allowing them to perform various operations on the library's collection. The system also includes feedback for successful actions and error handling for invalid inputs. 

This is purely Based on Java and OOps concept.
