# Library-Management-System
This Java code implements a simple Library Management System. It defines two main classes: Book, which represents individual books with attributes like title, author, and availability, and Library, which manages a collection of books. Users can add, remove, search for, borrow, and return books through a command-line interface. The main method provides a menu-driven approach for user interaction, allowing them to perform various operations on the library's collection. The system also includes feedback for successful actions and error handling for invalid inputs.
