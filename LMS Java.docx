This Java code implements a simple Library Management System, allowing users to manage a collection of books through a command-line interface. 
It consists of two main classes: Book and Library. The Book class encapsulates the properties of a book, including its title, author, and 
availability status. The constructor initializes these attributes, and various getter methods provide access to them. Additionally, there is a 
method to change the availability of the book, along with a toString method that formats the book's information for easy display.

The Library class manages a collection of Book objects using an ArrayList. It provides several functionalities:
      1) Adding Books: Users can add new books to the library.
      2) Removing Books: Users can remove books based on their title, with feedback if the book is not found.
      3) Displaying Available Books: The system can list all books currently available for borrowing.
      4) Searching for Books: Users can search for specific books, receiving a message whether the book exists and is available.
      5) Borrowing and Returning Books: The library allows users to borrow books if they are available and return them, updating the availability 
        status accordingly.
        
In the main method, a menu-driven approach facilitates user interaction. Initially, the system adds a few books to the library. 
The user is presented with a menu that includes options to display available books, borrow or return books, add or remove books, and search for books. 
The user's choice dictates which action to perform, with appropriate prompts for necessary input.

The Program is completely based on OOPs concept.
